Hey my name is... meh whatever it doesn't matter im just <b> ... shit it doesn't work 
  (damn this is stupid)... so i was saying that i'm new to this software/website and im also
  new to coding so if anyone could teach me how to code in any language it would be nice (btw i don't really know anything about coding,
  i just feel like its my domain)
